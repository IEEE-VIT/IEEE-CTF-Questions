//Texted Madhav Bhaiya for adding the location and currently unable to add more followings so stuck there at 265.

## Q: I LEARNT THE IMPORTANCE OF BRANDING FROM IEEEVIT'S INSTAGRAM.

## SOLUTION: THERES A POST WITH THE EXACT NAME ON OUR INSTAGRAM,

-A LOCATION 'CIPHER' WILL BE ADDED TO THAT POST, THAT LOCATION HAS A POST along with 8 other posts

- On opening that users profile named as 'plusandminusisimportant',one post has A twirled IMAGE which should create suspicion with caption as `LHS!=RHS`

- THE USER HAS 400 FOLLOWINGS THUS UNSWIRLING THAT IMAGE BOTH BY +400 AND -400 WILL GIVE THEM THE TWO PARTS OF THE FLAG

- +400=>IEEECTF{5WIRL_
- -400=>LR1W5}

- FLAG: IEEECTF{5WIRL_LR1W5}
