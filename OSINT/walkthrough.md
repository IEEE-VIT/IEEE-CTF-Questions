The File directory of our website has an audio file named 'n00b' which is DTMF encoded.
You need to decode this dual tone multiple frequency (the normal keypad tone thus predictable)
You will get a string of numbers which is ASCII code, 
73 69 69 69 86 73 84 115 32 73 78 83 84 65 71 82 65 77 32 66 82 65 78 68 73 78 71 32 73 83 32 83 85 83 80 73 67 73 79 85 83
Decoding this ASCII code,
you will get the string as: 
```
## IEEE-VITs INSTAGRAM BRANDING IS SUSPICIOUS
```
Go to IEEE-VITs Instagram and you will find a post that says the "the importance of BRANDING"
Once you find that post, it has a location attached with it as "Cipher"
This locations has 2 other posts, one random and the other as a blank white image with a caption as: "Why should I post this here? I have something really cool on my profile"
The users handle is "plusandminusisimportant"
On opening that user's profile, we have a post which looks like it has been swirled.
Now the users bio is "+_ Why am i following around 400 people?"
This is a hint as the user has to swirl the image in clockwise and anticlockwise direction by 400 points to get the two parts of the hint ie 
- ieee-vit claps JuSt
- on medium
```


## ieee-vit claps JuSt on medium
```
Find IEEE-VIT Techloop on Medium
Under the claps, you will find 2 JavaScript blogs, one reactjs which would not have any lead and the other of JS with IoT
Under the JS with IoT Blog,there is a comment from a user named as My_Fav_No_JS_6
On opening that user's profile, they find a URL (https://textsaver.flap.tv/lists/3omc)
That pastebin URL leads them to a JSfuck encoded string(which is encoding Javascript with just 6 characters):
which on decoding says: 
```

## Two of our 2019-20 board members made it to Google's Open Source's Summer program.<br/> One of them also published a paper on Distributed Machine Learning on Differentially Private Data<br/> While surfing Twitter a couple of months ago, I found out he likes robotic arm.<br/>

Mayank Bhaiya's Twitter Bio as well as Linkedin has GSOC mentioned and so does Ashvath Bhaiya's Linkedin.

A pinned tweet from this user on their profile that says:

## GAKKO AND I DEVELOPED OUR FIRST STYLISH IDEA IN THE CHATROOM<br/>
```
On googline Gakko and IEEE together, they will find our Gakko GitHub repo,
They need to get to the chatroom development branch,
Here they need to get in the .idea directory.
Now in the codestyles directory (as the hint says stylish)
They will find an opensourced.md file

It contains 28 lines of random lorem ipsum.
Connecting all the 28 lines' first letter (as mentioned in the first clue as "the first letter is really important somewhere")
they get the flag.
```

`FLAG: IEEECTF{OPENSOURCEISTHEBEST}`
