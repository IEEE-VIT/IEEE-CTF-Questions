After downloading the challenge file, we analyzed it with file which gave us DOS/MBR type so we researched it more with mmls -t dos data which gave us 512 FAT32 USB disk. We used foremost to carve the data out and follow the procedure as given:
1.
# foremost -i data 

which will generate the new folder as output with all the files extracted. we can view audit.txt to get more info on all files carved out.

2. In the PNG folder we saw image with presidentâ€™s camera.

3. Then we tried with exiftools to extract the image exif data to get some info about the location, turns out it was deleted.

4. Upon researching more we checked into zip folder which gave us another image of camera in the pictures folder so we checked with exiftools again as :
exiftool camera.jpg

which gave us the image location as Latitude and Longitude ðŸ˜‰ :
North or South Latit|N
Latitude            |43, 27, 52.038
East or West Longitu|E
Longitude           |11, 52, 53.322
