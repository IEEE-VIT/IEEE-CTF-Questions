CTF question1:

first u need to open the file,there will be a Hint and u will see a statement there,

so it is a hint to a link, where a file is uploaded
there are two encryptions used for this,
the last strings looks like rotation after a few hit and trial u will get a hint as base encoded,
then if u will try for decoding it through base

as soon as you crack this link,
u will see a HTML file, when you open it in browser and click on the print button,
u will see a page showing contents hidden in the black.
when u decode the strings using the ROT 13 you will be get the hint telling that black bg is acctually a image 
for which u will have to reverse it 
the final decoded code will be the password to the stegonized image. There will also bee a hint in the source code of the page, which will give u a hint for steghide 
u will recieve a file containing a flag...
